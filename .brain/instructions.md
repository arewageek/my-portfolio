# AI Agent System Instructions

**CRITICAL RULE: Always read and reference the `.brain` directory before starting any planning or building tasks.**

## 1. Context Hierarchy
- **vision.md**: Defines the **"What"** and **"Why"**. (Product purpose, business goals, target audience).
- **blueprint.md**: Defines the **"How"**. (Technical architecture, design system, infrastructure).
- **memory/**: The "Learned Rules" and project-specific standards.
  - `global.md`: Universal architectural rules applicable across all projects.
  - `project.md`: Local rules and unique architectural decisions for the current project.
  - `temp.md`: **Checkpointing & Critical Context**. Use this to preserve intent and architectural plans across long-running tasks or model sessions to prevent context loss.
- **task.md**: The "Current Focus". Tracks the breakdown of prioritized features into actionable steps.

## 2. Memory Structure Standards
To ensure efficiency and cheap context lookup, all memory files (`global.md`, `project.md`) must follow this strictly topical structure:

### Topic-Based Grouping
- Use `## TOPIC_NAME` for broad categories (e.g., `## AUTHENTICATION`, `## STYLING`).
- Use `### SUB_TOPIC` for specific implementation areas.
- Group ALL related rules, preferences, and architectural decisions under their respective topics.
- **NEVER** scatter related information across multiple sections.

### Entry Formatting
- **RULE**: Clear, concise rule statement.
- **CONTEXT**: Brief explanation of the "Why" and when it applies.
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Specific code patterns or directory constraints.

## 3. Decision Framework
- **Stay Aligned**: Ensure all code and feature implementations align with the business goals in `vision.md` and follow the technical standards in `blueprint.md`.
- **Reference First**: Always check `global.md` for coding standards and `project.md` for local exceptions before implementation.
- **Checkpointing**: For long or complex tasks, document your current intention, architectural plan, and "next steps" into `temp.md` frequently. This ensures the next session can continue seamlessly without breaking existing logic.

## 4. Workflow Maintenance
- **Task Breakdown**: Whenever a new feature is prioritized, break it down step-by-step into actionable tasks in `task.md`.
- **Auto-Capture Rule**: Whenever a rule or preference is emphasized (using words like "always", "never", "must"), capture it immediately into the appropriate topic section in `project.md` or `global.md`.
- **Cleanliness**: Ensure all system-level documentation remains strictly within the `.brain/` directory.
